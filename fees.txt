** JCE dev-fees ***

Devfees are:
  0.0% when using at least one mining thread with non-AES architecture
  0.0% when using 32-bits version
  0.0% when using only 64-bits AES architecture
 0.0% when using the --donate parameter

And no fees are taken during the first minute,
in case you want to do a fee-free test.
